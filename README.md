# 04-Challenge-CodeQuiz

## Description
This website generates a coding quiz. Once you start there's a timer countdown and you have to answer the several questions. Once finished it will take you to a high scores screen where you can enter in your initials to keep track of your scores.

## Usage
This website is for anyone wanting to take a quick coding quiz. Click the start button and you will be redirected to a new page with a question and the timer will start counting down. If you click the correct answer it will highlight green and your score will increase and it will move onto the next question. If you click the wrong answer it will highlight red and move onto the next question. Once you finish the quiz, you will have the option to put in your initials under high scores so you can keep track of your different scores from the quiz.
